### Caption 2 — Design Process Carousel

> How I designed a "minimalist luxury" water tracker:
>
> 1. The water IS the interface — no progress bars, the full-screen animation is your progress
> 2. One tap to log — every extra step is a reason to stop using the app
> 3. Color as reward — 5 themes, each one earned
> 4. Celebrate the goal — ripple rings when you hit your daily target
>
> Design details in the carousel. The app is called Rivulet and it's free.

### Caption 3 — Aesthetic / Lifestyle

> Your daily reminder to drink water, but make it beautiful.
>
> I couldn't find a water tracker that I actually wanted to open every day. So I built one with a full-screen water animation, tap-to-log simplicity, and a celebration effect that's honestly my favorite part.
>
> It's called Rivulet. It's free. It doesn't collect your data. It just helps you drink water.
