# Launch Schedule

A two-week day-by-day plan for launching Rivulet.

## Pre-Launch (Day -1)

**Date:** The day before soft launch

- [ ] Finalize all app store listings (screenshots, descriptions, keywords)
- [ ] Record 3-4 screen recordings of the app for social content (water animation, tap interaction, celebration effect, widget, each color theme)
- [ ] Create GIFs from screen recordings for Reddit/Twitter
- [ ] Prepare all Reddit posts in draft (copy from reddit-posts.md)
- [ ] Prepare Product Hunt submission in draft (do NOT publish yet)
- [ ] Set up a simple landing page or linktree with both store links
- [ ] Write a short "launch" message for friends and family group chats

## Day 0 — Soft Launch (Monday)

**Theme:** Friends, family, and inner circle only.

| Time (ET) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 9:00 AM | Publish the app on both stores (or confirm it's live if already submitted) |
| 10:00 AM | Send personal messages to friends/family asking them to download, use it for a day, and leave honest feedback |
| 10:30 AM | Post in any private Slack/Discord communities you're part of (dev groups, friend servers) — casual tone, "hey I made a thing" |
| Throughout day | Monitor for crashes, critical bugs, or store listing issues |

## Day 1 — Reddit Seeding, Round 1 (Tuesday)

**Theme:** Developer community posts.

| Time (ET) | Action |

| 9:00 PM | Review engagement. Note which angles resonated (technical? design? personal story?) for future content. |

**Do NOT post to consumer-facing subs yet.** Let the dev posts establish credibility first.

## Week 2 — Sustain and Iterate

### Day 8 (Tuesday)

| Time (ET) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 9:00 AM | Post **Tweet 5** (celebration animation showcase) with video. |
| 12:00 PM | If any Reddit posts are still getting comments, continue engaging. |
| 3:00 PM | Reach out to 3-5 small app review blogs/YouTubers with a personal email. Not a template — write each one individually. Focus on the design/animation angle. |

### Day 9 (Wednesday)

| Time (ET) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 10:00 AM | Post **Instagram Carousel 3** (aesthetic/lifestyle angle). |
| 2:00 PM | Create a new piece of content based on Week 1 feedback. Example: "5 things I learned launching my first app" tweet thread or Reddit post. |
| 6:00 PM | If you have any user testimonials or nice reviews, screenshot and share on Instagram Stories / Twitter. |

### Day 10 (Thursday)

| Time (ET) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 10:00 AM | Write and publish a dev blog post or Twitter thread about one technical aspect of the app (the Skia animation, the privacy-first approach, the "design as product" philosophy). Long-form content has a longer shelf life. |
| 3:00 PM | Share the blog post / thread across relevant communities. |

### Day 11 (Friday)

| Time (ET) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 10:00 AM | Review app store ratings and respond to every review (yes, every single one — positive and negative). |
| 2:00 PM | If installs are plateauing, consider a new angle: post in a different subreddit (r/apps, r/InternetIsBeautiful, r/coolgithubprojects if you open-source any part), or create a new TikTok with a different hook. |
| 5:00 PM | Start planning the first feature update based on user feedback. Announce it vaguely on Twitter: "Working on something you all asked for..." |

### Day 12-13 (Weekend)

| Time (ET) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Flexible | Light social media engagement. Respond to comments and DMs. |
| Flexible | Work on the feature update. |
| Sunday PM | Create a "Week 2 recap" for yourself — installs, retention, feedback themes, what content performed best, what flopped. |

### Day 14 (Monday)

| Time (ET) | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 9:00 AM | Post a "1 week since launch, here's what happened" thread on Twitter or Reddit (r/sideproject). Include real numbers if comfortable (installs, ratings, countries). The indie dev community loves transparency. |
| 12:00 PM | Plan Month 1 strategy based on everything learned. Key questions: Where did installs come from? What content worked? What features are most requested? Is the ad revenue sustainable? |
| 3:00 PM | If the feature update is ready, push it to stores and announce it. |

## Key Principles for the Entire Two Weeks

1. **Respond to everything.** Every Reddit comment, every Product Hunt question, every Twitter reply, every app review. You're a solo dev who cares. Act like it.

2. **Never post the same thing twice.** Each platform gets unique content tailored to its audience. Reddit wants depth. Twitter wants brevity. TikTok wants visuals. Instagram wants aesthetics.

3. **Don't be defensive about criticism.** If someone says "this is just another water tracker," respond with curiosity: "What would make it more than that for you?" Every critic is a potential user.

4. **Share real numbers.** The indie dev community respects transparency. If you got 500 installs in a week, say so. If you got 50, say that too. Authenticity builds trust.

5. **Don't spam.** One post per subreddit. One Product Hunt launch. Space out tweets. If something doesn't get traction, don't repost it — make something new instead.

6. **Track what works.** Keep a simple spreadsheet: platform, post type, engagement, installs attributed. After two weeks you'll know exactly where to focus your energy going forward.
