    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 13, 2026</p>

    <p>Butter Lemonade ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Rivulet mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or process any personal information.</strong></p>

    <p>Rivulet is designed with your privacy as a priority. All data you generate while using the App — including your hydration logs, goals, preferences, and settings — is stored locally on your device only. We have no access to this information, and it is never transmitted to our servers or any third party.</p>

    <h2>No Account Required</h2>
    <p>Rivulet does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number. You can use the App completely anonymously.</p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data generated by your use of the App is stored locally on your device using standard device storage mechanisms. This data remains on your device and is not synchronized to any cloud service or external server operated by us.</p>

    <p>If you uninstall the App, all locally stored data will be deleted from your device according to your device's operating system policies.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Rivulet uses Google AdMob to display advertisements within the App. AdMob may collect certain information to provide personalized ads and analytics. This information is collected and processed by Google, not by us.</p>

    <p>The information collected by AdMob may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (such as device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers)</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data</li>
        <li>IP address and general location information</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Google AdMob's data collection and use practices are governed by Google's Privacy Policy, which you can review here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

    <p>You may opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings or visiting Google's ad settings page.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Rivulet does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any personal information, the App can be used by individuals of all ages. However, parents and guardians should be aware that the App displays third-party advertisements through Google AdMob.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store any personal information, there is no personal data for us to access, modify, or delete. All data within the App is under your direct control on your device.</p>
